# fastai-pytorch-playground

The repository contains two main files:
* titanic-fastai.ipynb - create a simple model using FastAI library
* titanic-pytorch.ipynb - create a model using Pytorch framework

Both notebooks contain preprocessing, data cleaning, and data preparation steps. The goal of those notebooks was to check the differences between FastAI and Pytorch, and also to learn Pytorch by doing a simple project. I covered both theoretical and practical aspects of creating and building Deep Neural Networks using both libraries.
